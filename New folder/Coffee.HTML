    <h1>Difference kind of coffee</h1>

    <br>
    <p>There is so many kind of coffees thet you can choos from. That has varying combinations of espresso, milk and flavorings of the drinks. 
    This is only warm coffee.</p>
    
    <h2>The history of coffee</h2>

    <p> In the 9th Century the innovation on the Ethiopian Plateau.a goat herder named Kaldi was the first person who discovered coffee beans and their benefits.
    Kaldi noticed that after his goats ate the cherries of a particular tree in the ancient coffee forests of the Ethiopian plateau,
    they were so full of energy that they didn't want to sleep at night. </p>
    
    <h3>15th-16th Centuries coffee culture</h3>

    <p>The business edition of coffee history began on the Arabian Peninsula, where people cultivated and traded coffee for the first time. By the 15th century,
     coffee was being grown in what is now Yemen, and by the 16th century it gained popularity in what we now know as Iran, Egypt, Syria, and Turkey.</p>
    <p>It was calld the wisdom in a cup.At this time, you could drink coffee at home, but you might also go to one of the many public coffee houses, or qahveh khaneh, that had started popping up in
    cities across the region now referred to as the Middle East. At these thriving social hubs, you not only could sip your coffee and chat, but you could listen to music, watch performances, 
    play chess, and stay current on the news. In fact, coffee houses were so vital to the exchange of information at the time that they were also known as Schools of the Wise.</p>  

    <h2>17th Century: Growth of Coffee Consumption in Europe</h2>

    <p>By the 17th century, coffee had made its way to Europe and was becoming popular across the continent. </p>

      <h3>A threat and a triumph</h3>

        <p>Not everyone embraced coffee right away. Some people reacted with suspicion and fear, even going so far as 
        to call it the “bitter invention of Satan.” When coffee came to Venice in 1615, local clergy condemned it, sparking a 
        controversy so great that Pope Clement VIII was asked to intervene. After tasting coffee for himself, he found it so satisfying 
        that he gave it papal approval.</p>

        <h2>20th-21st Centuries: Growing the Coffee Community in the U.S.</h2>
        <p>Coffee—and the way we drink it—has continued to evolve. In the 20th and 21st centuries, we’ve seen several “waves” of coffee that 
        represent both a type of coffee and an accompanying shift in coffee culture. The first wave of coffee arose as industrialization 
        allowed for mass production. This is the coffee that first hit the shelves of grocery stores, and it provided functionality and 
        convenience. Individuals, restaurants and other businesses could buy this coffee, sold in bulk and mostly pre-ground, and make it daily.
         There was little focus on origin, and few people in the U.S. even realized coffee grows on trees!</p>
